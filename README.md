How did i build the UI for the data analytics?
---
i have used this program called tableau public for the data visualisation.
it does not cost any money to use tableau public if you are keen to try
to use a data visualation tool.

I build the data visualisation tool and link it to the google sheet database.
if you are keen to see the raw dataset, here is the link below.
